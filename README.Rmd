Tools to Work with the 'Feedly' 'API'

## Description

'Feedly' is a news aggregator application for various web browsers and mobile devices running 'iOS' and 'Android', also available as a cloud-based service. It compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources for the user to customize and share with others. Methods are provided to retrieve information about and contents of 'Feedly' collections and streams.

## What's Inside The Tin

The following functions are implemented:

- `feedly_access_token`:	Retrieve the Feedly Developer Token
- `feedly_connections`:	Retrieve Feedly Connections
- `feedly_feed_meta`:	Retrieve Metadata for a Feed
- `feedly_opml`:	Retrieve Your Feedly OPML File
- `feedly_profile`:	Retrieve Your Feedly Profile
- `feedly_search_contents`:	Search content of a stream
- `feedly_search_title`:	Find feeds based on title, url or '#topic'
- `feedly_stream`:	Retrieve contents of a Feedly "stream"
- `feedly_tags`:	Retrieve List of Tags

The following helper references are available:

- `global_resource_ids`:	Global Resource Ids Helper Reference

## Authentication (README)

You need a developer token to access most of the API endpoints. You can do that via links provdied by (<https://developer.feedly.com/v3/auth/>). There are no plans to support OAuth or token refreshing unless there is sufficient demand via Git[la|hu]b issues & issue votes.

### NOT ALL ENDPOINTS REQUIRE AUTHENTICATION

Neither `feedly_search_title()` nor `feedly_stream()` require authentication (i.e. you do not need a developer token) to retrieve the contents of the API call. For `feedly_stream()` You _do_ need to know the Feedly-structured feed id which is (generally) `feed/FEED_URL` (e.g. `feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/RBloggers`).
