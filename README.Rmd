Tools to Work with the 'Feedly' 'API'

## Description

'Feedly' is a news aggregator application for various web browsers and mobile devices running 'iOS' and 'Android', also available as a cloud-based service. It compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources for the user to customize and share with others. Methods are provided to retrieve information about and contents of 'Feedly' collections and streams.

## What's Inside The Tin

The following functions are implemented:

- `feedly_access_token`:	Retrieve the Feedly Developer Token
- `feedly_connections`:	Retrieve Feedly Connections
- `feedly_stream`:	Retrieve contents of a Feedly "stream"

## Authentication (README)

You need a developer token to access most of the API endpoints. You can do that via links provdied by (<https://developer.feedly.com/v3/auth/>). There are no plans to support OAuth or token refreshing unless there is sufficient demand via Git[la|hu]b issues & issue votes.

### NOT ALL ENDPOINTS REQUIRE AUTHENTICATION

If you pass in a Feedly-structured feed id to `feedly_stream()` you do **not**
need to authenticate (i.e. you do not need a developer token) to retrieve the contents. You _do_ need to know the Feedly-structured feed id which is (generally) `feed/FEED_URL` (e.g. `feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/RBloggers`).

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/seymour")

library(seymour)
library(tidyverse) # mostly for printing

# current verison
packageVersion("seymour")

```

```{r cache=TRUE}
coll <- feedly_connections()

filter(coll, title == "R-bloggers") %>%
